## SQL examples
In this project, we try to solve examples of SQL statements in four different categories.

 1. **SELECT:** statement is used to select data from a database.
The data returned is stored in a result table, called the result-set.[example photos](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1zbBNfQJKzQmIbvMTm-JnnL732BahNWET?usp=sharing)
 
 
 2. **WHERE:**  clause is used to filter records.
It is used to extract only those records that fulfill a specified condition.[example photos](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1r6p30-rAHlZo6q_rt9N7rx0Fz_DeAcf2?usp=sharing)


 3. **Aggregate functions:** SQL is excellent at aggregating data we try to cover lots of its angels.[example photos](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1A08rXpAAHFkh6R_pAOhIkmPYTf1Odn3U?usp=sharing)


 4. **SQL join**clause is used to combine rows from two or more tables, based on a related column between them.[example photos](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/149OuGVq9gMTqZ3E9SpoPQVUj9rK7fcOK?usp=sharing)

These examples will help you to step by step improve your SQL skills.

if you are going to solve examples like this project you can use the HackerRank website.[link](https://www.hackerrank.com/)
